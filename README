# Orc_π Calculus: Prototype and Evaluation Data

This repository contains the Python prototype and evaluation data for the paper "Orc_π Calculus: A Formal Framework for Web Services Choreography with Semantics and Projection," submitted to the *Journal of Computer Languages*. The prototype implements the \(\text{Orc}_\pi\) Calculus for simulating Web services and IoT choreographies, and the evaluation data includes traces and metrics for case studies \( C_{\text{ecomm}} \) and \( C_{\text{IoT}} \).

## Prototype Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `prototype/src/requirements.txt`
  - Paho-MQTT 1.6.1 (`pip install paho-mqtt==1.6.1`)
  - CoAPthon 4.0.2 (`pip install coapthon==4.0.2`)
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Hardware**: Minimum 4 GB RAM, 2 GHz CPU (recommended: 16 GB RAM, 2.4 GHz multi-core CPU for large-scale simulations)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isaacyang-2025/orcpi-calculus.git
   cd orcpi-calculus
   
2. Navigate to the prototype directory:
    cd prototype
    
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r src/requirements.txt

4. Verify installation:
python src/orcpi_calculus.py --test
